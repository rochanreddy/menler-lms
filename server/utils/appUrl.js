// LMS_APP_URL is overloaded: index.js splits it on commas to build the CORS
// allowlist, so a preview deployment can be allowed without editing code. That
// makes the raw value a LIST — in production it is
// "https://lms.menler.in,https://menler-lms.vercel.app" — and anything that
// treats it as a single origin produces a URL whose host parses as
// "lms.menler.in,https", which resolves nowhere.
//
// So: one place that answers "which origin do we send people to", and it is
// the first entry. First rather than last because the list is written with the
// real domain leading and the preview trailing, and a preview URL in a
// student's inbox outlives the preview.
